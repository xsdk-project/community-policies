Each package should use a **limited and well-defined symbol, macro, library, and
include file name space**. For example, there should be no publicly visible
include files such as utils.h, or package named libutil.a or macros name YES or
TRUE. Namespacing of include files can be handled either by prepending each
include file with a package name, for example <XXXmat.h>, or by placing and
referencing all include files in a subdirectory with a package name, for example
<XXX/mat.h>. Note that using a -I/XXX/ and referencing via <mat.h> would not be
acceptable namespacing.
