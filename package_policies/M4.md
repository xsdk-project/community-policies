Each package team must do a “best effort” at **portability to common
platforms**, including standard Linux distributions, and common compiler
toolchains such as GNU, Clang,^4^ and vendor compilers. **Further portability
requirements for xSDK subsets may be conditionally applied based on sponsor
requirements**.^5^ Support for Apple Mac OS and Microsoft Windows Visual Studio
is recommended.

-------

^4^ This does not mean that xSDK packages and all their dependencies cannot have
a dependency of Fortran, merely that the C and C++ portions of the packages and
their dependencies should be compilable with the Clang compilers.

^5^ For example, xSDK packages that receive funding from the mathematical
libraries component of the U.S.  Department of Energy (DOE) Exascale Computing
Project (ECP) must support portability to target machines at the computing
facilities ALCF, NERSC, and OLCF.
