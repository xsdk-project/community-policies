# R3

It is recommended that each package **adopt and document a consistent system for
propagating/returning error conditions/exceptions** and provide an API for
changing the behavior.  For example, all routines may, by default, return an
error code with the option of changing it to generate an abort on the error (for
running in the debugger). No package should have hardwired calls to abort, exit,
or MPI_Abort(). Also, no package should have hardwired print statements for
error conditions. Each package should document which error codes/exceptions are
recoverable, which may result in lost resources (for example, unfreed memory),
and which indicate that the process may be in an undefined or totally broken
state (for example, after a segmentation violation). It is the responsibility of
the calling routine not to simply continue the computation when a “hard” error
is returned; the calling routine will likely, by default, call an abort, but
again that should be possible to override.
