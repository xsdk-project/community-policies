**R5.** It is recommended that each package provide a **mechanism to export its ordered list of library
dependencies** so that any other package or executable linking to the package knows to include these
dependencies when linking.

RATIONALE: When using static libraries,  some compilers require the libraries in the link command to be listed in the correct dependency order - to avoid unresolved symbol errors.

One way this information can  be provided  to the users is via *pkg-config* file.
