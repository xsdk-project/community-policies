**R5.** It is recommended that each package provide a **mechanism to export its ordered list of library
dependencies** so that any other package or executable linking to the package knows to include these
dependencies when linking.

The motivation for this policy was that sometimes the order of linking static libraries matters to prevent
unresolved symbol errors.

The user should have easily accessible information to facilitate linking to the library. This
information could be provided by a *pkg-config* file, for example.
