# M13

When configured with a prefix, a package must install its headers and libraries
under `<install-prefix>/include/` and `<install-prefix>/lib/`, respectively. In
addition, the library and header file names should not have the version number
embedded (except for shared libraries that can have soname versions and symlinks
like `lib<package>.so -> lib<package>.so.X -> lib<package>.so.X.Y.Z`).
