**M13.** When configured with a prefix, a package must install its headers and libraries under
`<install-prefix>/include/` and `<install-prefix>/[lib,lib64]/`, respectively. In addition, the library
and header file names should not have the version number embedded (except for shared libraries that can have
soname versions and symlinks like `lib<package>.so -> lib<package>.so.X -> lib<package>.so.X.Y.Z`).

The aim of this policy is to prevent packages from installing into a non-standard directory layout
and for other xSDK packages to be able to detect the location of include files and libraries.
