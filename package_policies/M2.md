# M2

Each xSDK-compatible package must provide a **comprehensive test suite** that
can be run by users and does not require the purchase of commercial software. It
is recommended that at least a significant subset of the test suite will
complete within a few hours on standard workstation-level hardware. It is also
recommended that at least a significant subset of the tests be runnable in
batch-only environments, that is, systems that require the use of PBS or other
submission scripts.
