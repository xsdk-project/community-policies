# R7

It is recommended that each package should have a README or README.md, a SUPPORT
or SUPPORT.md, a LICENSE or LICENSE.md, and a CHANGELOG or CHANGELOG.md file in
its top directory.  The README file should contain at least the following
information:

- a **brief** description of the package

- information on how to install the package or a link to a file (e.g. INSTALL,
INSTALL.md or similar) or a website with the installation information

- a link to the package webpage (if there is one)

The LICENSE file should contain the full text of the license. If the full text
can be found in a different directory or via a link to a website it is
sufficient to provide a link to the full text in the file.

The SUPPORT file should contain the contact information that is required by
community policy **M5** to be able to get help.

The CHANGELOG file should contain important changes or a link to a file or
webpage with this information, but not each individual commit message.

If providing additional information, e.g. on how to contribute, authorship, code
of conduct, etc, it is recommended to consider suggestions in
