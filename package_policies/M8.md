# M8

Each package must provide **a runtime API**, for example a function call, to
return the **current version number** of the software and indicate what
configure/CMAKE and compiler options were used to build the package. For
development versions of the software, each package must provide the current
commit ID in the repository. With this information users should be able to
rebuild the package in the same state. We do not currently require that version
information for all dependent packages be provided, so it may not be possible to
rebuild the entire software stack in the same state.
