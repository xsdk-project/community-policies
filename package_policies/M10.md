# M10

It is mandatory that each package have an xSDK-accessible **repository** (not
necessarily publicly available), where the development version of the package is
available.  Support for taking **pull requests** is also recommended since this
will greatly ease the effort among the development teams to improve
interoperability and quickly provide bug fixes.
