**M10.** It is mandatory that each package have a **public repository**, for example at GitHub,
GitLab or Bitbucket, where the development version of the package is available. Support for taking
**pull requests** is also recommended since this will ease the efforts among xSDK library
development teams to improve interoperability and quickly provide bug fixes and also allow users
to provide improvements to the packages.
