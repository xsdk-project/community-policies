# R4

It is recommended that each package **free all system resources it has
acquired** as soon as they are no longer needed. This recommendation includes
closing open files, freeing memory, freeing MPI communicators, and freeing MPI
data types created by the package. In particular, it is crucial that xSDK
compatible code not have any growing memory leaks (such as leaking memory during
every timestep). Any resources created by the package that should be freed by
the user, rather than by the package, must be fully documented. Valgrind can be
used to locate when these resources are mistakenly not released.
