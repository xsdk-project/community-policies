# M12

If a package imports software that is externally developed and maintained,^8^
then it must allow installing, building, and linking against an outside copy of
that software.  Acceptable ways to accomplish this include (1) forsaking the
internal copied version and using an externally provided implementation or (2)
changing the file names and namespaces of all global symbols to allow the
internal copy and the external copy to coexist in the same downstream libraries
and programs.

------

^8^ For example, some projects import source for some routines from BLAS and
LAPACK. The Trilinos Teuchos package imported an early version of the boost::any
class. Also, Trilinos has its own copy of an older version of SparseSuite. In
the latter two cases, new file names and namespaces were created for the
imported software to allow coexistence with the (updated) external versions.
