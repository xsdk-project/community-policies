# M1

Each xSDK-compatible package must support either the **community GNU Autoconf or
CMake options**^3^ as defined in the following document:

[xSDK Community Installation Policies: GNU Autoconf and CMake
Options](./community-installation-policies.md).

The goal of this policy is to enable individual users, computing centers, and
package managers (such as [Spack](https://spack.io/)) to install the package in
a way that is compatible with other xSDK packages on the same system. It is
understood that managing all the dependencies for a variety of packages is
nontrivial and is not resolved by standard options.

-----

^3^ Note that the package is free to use any mechanism, for example Python as
PETSc does, to implement the options but to users they should appear as if a
CMake or GNU Autoconf configure package.
