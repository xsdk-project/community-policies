**R1.** Each package should have at least one validation (smoke) test that can be invoked through the Spack package.  This will be a post-installation test that validates the usability of the package and must be executable via `spack test run <package_name>`.

Policy compliance requires that the `spack test run` interface works on a standalone system. For MPI tests, MPICH or Open MPI may be used.

Some xSDK packages with existing validation tests include PETSc, Tasmanian, and libEnsemble.

This policy enables successful installation to be quickly tested before proceeding with more resource-intensive tests. Further information can be found in the Spack packaging guide.
