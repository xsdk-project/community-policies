# M11

No package should have hardwired print or I/O statements that cannot be turned
off through a programmatic interface^6^; output should never be hard-wired to
stdout or stderr. It is recommended that packages provide a way for users to
turn on output and allow them to direct where it goes.^7^ Also, packages may
print to stdout by default but only on one process (i.e., root rank “0”). But
packages may also be completely silent by default (and require that users turn
on outputting in the appropriate way).


------

^6^ Packages should not exclusively use environmental variables as a
programmatic interface since other packages that may be controlling the
simulation process cannot set such environmental variables. There must be an API
that can be called from with the source code. It is fine to also support using
environmental variables, but that cannot be the only way.

^7^ For example, allowing users to control output in a C++ package means that
the package must accept an arbitrary std::ostream object and all output should
go to that object. In C, the package should accept a FILE object to which it can
direct its output.
