# xSDK Community Package Policies

The IDEAS Project xSDK Team

Version 0.5.0, June 27, 2019

[https://xsdk.info/policies](https://xsdk.info/policies)

## Background

A key aspect of work in the [IDEAS Scientific Software Productivity Project][1]
is developing an Extreme-scale Scientific Software Development Kit ([xSDK][2]) â€”
a collection of related and complementary software elements that provide the
building blocks, tools, models, processes, and related artifacts for rapid and
efficient development of high-quality applications. As an initial step in
creating xSDK, we have written the following draft xSDK package community
policies to help address challenges in interoperability and sustainability of
software developed by diverse groups at different institutions.

## Goal

Develop a set of **xSDK community policies** that a software library/framework
(henceforth referred to as package)^1^ must satisfy in order to to be **xSDK
compatible** .  The designation of a package being xSDK compatible informs
potential users that the package can be easily used with other xSDK libraries
and components and thus helps to address issues in long-term sustainability^2^
and interoperability among packages.

We consider two categories of xSDK packages: **xSDK compatible** packages and
**xSDK member** packages. We also consider two levels of xSDK compatibility:
**mandatory policies** and **recommended policies**.

+ A package will be declared **xSDK compatible** once the xSDK team has 
determined that the **package satisfies the mandatory xSDK policies** listed
below. In addition to the required policies, we specify **recommended xSDK
policies** that further help to address issues in software interoperability.

+ Similarly, a package can become an **xSDK member package** if (1) it is an 
xSDK-compatible package, *and* (2) it uses or can be used by another package in
xSDK, and the connecting interface is regularly tested for regressions.

Initially the requirements and process are informally presented; over time, if
needed, we can begin to formalize them. Currently, xSDK includes seventeen
popular numerical libraries:

1. [AMReX][13]
2. [DTK][14]
3. [deal.II][15]
4. [hypre][3]
5. [MAGMA][4]
6. [MFEM][5]
7. [Omega_h][16]
8. [PETSc/TAO][6]
9. [PHIST][17]
10. [PLASMA][18]
11. [PUMI][19]
12. [SLEPc][20]
13. [STRUMPACK][21]
14. [SUNDIALS][7]
15. [SuperLU][8]
16. [Tasmanian][22]
17. [Trilinos][9]

and two applications packages:

1. [Alquimia][10]
2. [PFLOTRAN][11],

which satisfy the required policies. Over the longer term, xSDK may expand to
incorporate additional packages, depending on community needs and contributions.

## xSDK Mandatory Policies

**M1.** [Support xSDK community GNU Autoconf or CMake
options.](/package_policies/M1.md)

**M2.** [Provide a comprehensive test suite for correctness of installation
verification.](/package_policies/M2.md)

**M3.** [Employ user-provided MPI communicator (no MPI_COMM_WORLD). Don't assume
a full MPI 3 implementation without checking. Provide an option to prevent any
changes to MPI error-handling if it is changed by
default.](/package_policies/M3.md)

**M4.** [Give best effort at portability to key architectures (standard Linux
distributions, GNU, Clang, vendor compilers, and target machines at ALCF, NERSC,
OLCF).](/package_policies/M4.md)

**M5.** [Provide a documented, reliable way to contact the development
team.](/package_policies/M5.md)

**M6.** [Respect system resources and settings made by other previously called
packages (e.g. signal handling).](/package_policies/M6.md)

**M7.** [Come with an open source (BSD style) license.](/package_policies/M7.md)

**M8.** [Provide a runtime API to return the current version number of the
software.](/package_policies/M8.md)

**M9.** [Use a limited and well-defined symbol, macro, library, and include file
name space.](/package_policies/M9.md)

**M10.** [Provide an xSDK team accessible repository (not necessarily publicly
available).](/package_policies/M10.md)

**M11.** [Have no hardwired print or IO statements that cannot be turned
off.](/package_policies/M11.md)

**M12.** [For external dependencies, allow installing, building, and linking
against an outside copy of external software.](/package_policies/M12.md)

**M13.** [Install headers and libraries under `<prefix>/include` and
`<prefix>/lib`.](/package_policies/M13.md)
  
**M14.** [Be buildable using 64 bit pointers. 32 bit is
optional.](/package_policies/M14.md)

**M15.** [All xSDK compatibility changes should be
sustainable.](/package_policies/M15.md)

**M16.** [The package must support production-quality installation compatible
with the xSDK install tool and xSDK metapackage.](/package_policies/M16.md)

## xSDK Recommended Policies

In addition to the required xSDK policies listed above, the following
capabilities are also recommended.

**R1.** [Have a public repository](/package_policies/R1.md).

**R2.** [Possible to run test suite under valgrind in order to test for memory
corruption issues.](/package_policies/R2.md)

**R3.** [Adopt and document consistent system for error
conditions/exceptions.](/package_policies/R3.md)

**R4.** [Free all system resources acquired as soon as they are no longer
needed.](/package_policies/R4.md)

**R5.** [Provide a mechanism to export ordered list of library
dependencies.](/package_policies/R5.md)

**R6.** [Document versions of packages that it works with or depends upon,
preferably in machine-readable form.](/package_policies/R6.md)

**R7.** [Have README, SUPPORT, LICENSE, and CHANGELOG files in top
directory.](/package_policies/R7.md)

## History of the xSDK Community Policies

The original version of this document was prepared in 2015 by Barry Smith with
key input from Roscoe Bartlett and feedback from members of the IDEAS project.
Over time, revisions have been introduced based on discussions with the broader
computational science community and developers of an expanding collection of
xSDK member packages. We thank all xSDK package developers, the IDEAS team, and
the scientific computing community for insightful discussion about issues and
approaches.

+ Changes in version 0.5.0, June 27, 2019:
    * Added new policy R7, which recommends the inclusion of various information 
files in the top directory
    * Dropped the requirement to detect MPI 2 features in M3 Made various
    * Editorial changes in M5, M13, M15, and R2 for clarification or 
to fix typos
+ Changes in version 0.4.0, July 27, 2018:
    * Split policy M4 into 2 parts: M4 (portability to common platforms) and new 
policy R6 (package should document the versions of packages with which it can
work on on which it depends). See
https://github.com/xsdk-project/xsdk-issues/issues/55
    * Revision to M7: language about open source licensing requirements. See
https://github.com/xsdk-project/xsdk-issues/issues/56
    * New section on history of policies and summary of changes, misc minor edits
+ Changes in version 0.3.0, November 6, 2017: added 2 new policies (M15 and M16),
changed naming convention to follow xSDK release number, minor typo edits
+ Changes in version 0.3, December 2, 2016: clear definition of xSDK member packages, misc minor edits
+ Changes in version 0.2, January 28, 2016: minor edit
+ Version 0.1, November 10, 2015: original version

[//]: # "Main body footnotes"

^1^ For the purpose of this document, the term *package* refers to a collection
of source code (possibly containing C, Fortran, or C++) that can generate zero
or more shared or static libraries, zero or more include files, zero or more
Fortran modules, and possibly other auxiliary artifacts, including executables,
and whose functionality can be used by other packages and by application codes.
A software artifact that generates only an executable is, by this definition,
not an xSDK package; that is, xSDK packages are libraries, frameworks, and
domain components.

^2^ See, for example, "Self-Sustaining Software" as outlined in
http://trac.trilinos.org/wiki/TribitsLifecycleModelOverview#self_sustaining_software.
