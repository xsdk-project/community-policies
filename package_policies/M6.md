Each package should **respect the decisions made by other previously called
packages** regarding system resources and settings. For example, each package
may provide an API for changing the floating-point exception (FPE) and signal
handlers, and even set them in a particular way by default, but there must be a
way to prevent the change. Because it is impossible to determine the current
state of the FPE and signal handlers and thus restore them to the current state
after changing them, it is recommended that the xSDK packages adopt a common
protocol for pushing and popping FPE and signal handlers.
