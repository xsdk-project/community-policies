# I3

Select compilers^5^ and compiler flags.

1. If the compilers (and or flags) are explicitly set on input, use those:

    1. `CC=<cc>`,  `CXX=<cxx>`,  `FC=<fc>`,  `CPP`, `FFLAGS`, `FCFLAGS`, 
`CFLAGS`, `CXXFLAGS`, `CPPFLAGS`, `LDFLAGS`

    2. `CMAKE_C_COMPILER=<cc>`, `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<cxx>`, 
`CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=<fc>`, `CMAKE_C_FLAGS="<flag1> <flag2> ...”`, 
`CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=”...”`, `CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS=”...”`

2. If the compilers and/or flags are not explicitly set on input but are 
set in the environment variables
    `FC`, `CC`, `CXX`, `CPP`^6^, `FFLAGS`, `FCFLAGS`, `CFLAGS`, `CXXFLAGS`, 
`CPPFLAGS`,^7^ `LDFLAGS`, then the compilers and flags must be set to these.
If both `FFLAGS` and `FCFLAGS` are set, then they need to be the same or it
is an error.

3. If the compilers and/or compiler flags are not explicitly passed in or 
defined in the environment variables listed above, then the package is free
to try to find compilers on the system and set the compiler flags consistent
with the other settings defined below (e.g., shared libraries vs. static libraries, 
debug vs. non-debug).^8^

-----

^5^ Packages must support using the MPI compiler wrappers for these arguments.

^6^ The environment variable CPP is not supported by raw CMake.

^7^ The environment variable CPPFLAGS is not supported by raw CMake.

^8^ All CMake projects should use the same built-in CMake algorithm to find the 
default compilers, so even when no 
explicit compilers or flags are set they should use the same compilers and 
flags.  Also, raw CMake projects will append 
compiler flags based on the build type.  See "Selecting compiler and linker 
options".
