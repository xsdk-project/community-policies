# I10

Determine other package libraries and include directories.

1. `--with-<package> --with-<package>-lib="linkable list of libraries” 
--with-<package>-include=”list of include directories”`
2. `TPL_ENABLE_<package>=[YES,NO]`

Packages must provide a way for a user to specify a dependent package to use. 
Packages are free to locate a package on the file system if none is 
specifically provided by the user. If the user does provide one, however, it 
must be used; if it is not able to be used, then an error must be generated. A 
package cannot silently substitute a different installation.
